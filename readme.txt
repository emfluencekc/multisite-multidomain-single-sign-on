Avoid having to separately sign in to separate-domain sites of the same multisite installation!

== Description ==

When switching sites using the My Sites links in the admin menu,
this plugin will automatically authenticate you into the site that you're going to.

You do already have to be logged into a site in the network;
this plugin just cuts down on having to log in again due to cookie isolation between domains.

Note: This plugin must be installed on all sites in a network in order to work properly.

== Installation ==

Either:
* Add this plugin to the mu-plugins folder, or
* Add this plugin to the plugins folder, and network-enable it on all sites.
